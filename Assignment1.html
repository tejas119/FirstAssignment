            <h3>My Trip To California</h3>
            <p>It was a long, quick trip. We loaded our vehicle
                and headed to Northern California for the 4th of
                July weekend for a family reunin. We then made haste
                to Magic Moutain. By the time we returned home, we had traveled
                some 1300 miles in three and one half days. <p>

            <h3>My Trip To The Rockies</h3>
            <p>After a year's preparation, it was time to go backpacking with
                the Boy Scouts. We flew to Colorado Springs, toured the Air Force 
                Acadamy, Pike's Peak, Garden of the Gods, and the Olympic training center.
                We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch in Norther New Mexico and
                began our 60 miles backpack trek. Afterwards, we boarded Amtrack's and rode
                the rails to Kingman, and then chartered a bus home.

                to him in Indiana where he attends college.In route, we stopped at Nauvoo,
                Illinois and Detroit, Michigan.We then boarded Amtrak in Chicage, and
                rode it to Salk Lake City, where we boarded a bus which returned us to Las Vegas.
