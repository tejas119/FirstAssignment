            I am a lecturer in the StandFord Computer Science
            Department. Before coming to Standford, I spent two years
            as a programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I
            worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed
            to improve communication and coordination within small project teams.
            I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product 
            throughout an entire software lifecycle-from initial product conception
            through the actual product launch.

            I have a Ph.D from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized
            in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on process support for software
            engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization
            in Artificial Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical
            Engineering.<br>
